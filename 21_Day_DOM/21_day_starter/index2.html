            Killua has spiky silver hair, very pale skin, and blue eyes.
            His eyes change shape depending on the mood that he's in, narrowing
            and sharpening when he goes into assassination mode. Killua is 
            fairly lean at the start of the series, due to constant physical 
            conditioning and torture training he received when he was young. 
            As time passes, he becomes more muscular and toned. 
            In the Nippon Animation anime adaptation, Killua's eye color is changed to 
            green during the OVAs. He is also often seen holding a green skateboard (turned yellow in the 2011 series).
